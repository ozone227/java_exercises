## HashMap Intro

This was a simple exercise using:

* import java.util.HashMap;
* import java.util.Scanner;

Long story short... there's a HashMap with a smattering of data already populated. This application prompts the user with a handful of options.

Specifically:

Enter: <add> <student_name> <grade> to add a grade.
Enter: <remove> <student_name> <grade> to remove a grade.
Enter: <change> <student_name> <grade> to change a grade.
Enter: <print> to print out all grades.

Oh. Also. 

This has zero logic and error handling.
