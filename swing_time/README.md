# Using Swing and Time

In this exercise, I was playing around with:

* java.util.Date;
* java.util.Random;
* javax.swing.*;
* java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
* java.awt.event.ActionListener;

This is just a sample of how to grab the time and throw it in a JFrame. Oddly enough, I randomized the background color for each ActionEvent using setBackground(). Fun.
