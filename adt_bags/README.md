** Overview **

Demonstrate an understanding of working with bags in Java by implementing a class called ClothingBag that implements the BagInterface<MyType> in Java.  The program will store corresponding items for a clothing boutique, specifically, the program should consider an item name and price.

The following values might be considered for data:
* Item_Name = “Red T-Shirt”;
* Price = $29.99;

After selecting your values for data, what are the required operations that must be used to create the bag Interface?


**The implementation should include the following:**

*Fields:*

* MyType[] myBag;
* int numberofProducts;
* Default_Capacity;

*Methods:*

* Constructor():  initialize bag
* add()– Will be used to add a new entry.
* toArray() – provides an array of the allocated bag
* isFull() – test whether the bag is at the maximum capacity.

** Implement a BoutiqueBagDemo that tests your bag implementation class.**

*Methods:*

* testAdd() – will add the contents to the bag.
* displayBag() – will display the contents of the bag.
